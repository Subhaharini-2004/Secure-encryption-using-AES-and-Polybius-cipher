# Secure-encryption-using-AES-and-Polybius-cipher
This project aims to develop an innovative, real-time secure encryption system 
combining the strengths of two encryption techniques: the Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES) and the Polybius cipher algorithm. 

The **AES algorithm** is a widely recognized symmetric key encryption standard that ensures robust data 
protection, making it suitable for highly sensitive applications. 

**The Polybius cipher**, an ancient method of encryption, transforms plaintext into a grid-based 
numeric code, providing an additional layer of security and obfuscation. By 
leveraging these two algorithms, the project offers a hybrid encryption solution 
that ensures high levels of security while maintaining efficiency in real-time 
applications.

The system is built using an **Arduino microcontroller** or you can also use **STM32**, which provides a cost
effective and efficient platform for processing encryption and decryption tasks. 
The Arduinoâ€™s embedded system capabilities allow the encryption system to be 
deployed in low-power, resource-constrained environments, making it ideal for 
real-time secure communications. 

This encryption system is optimized for performance, addressing the critical time 
constraints required in sensitive applications such as military or emergency 
communication. The project focuses on minimizing latency while providing 
robust protection against common security vulnerabilities, including brute-force 
attacks, frequency analysis, and known-plaintext attacks.
